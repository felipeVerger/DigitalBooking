I'm intending to create is a 3-tier infrastructure in AWS with a frontend, backend and database in which to deploy a full stack app containing a REST API developed in Java Spring Boot and a frontend using React.
The ci flow comes from a gitlab monorepo and is managed by a pipeline (runner to be defined) that finally deploys the app in AWS.
